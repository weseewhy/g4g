A number can always be represented as a sum of squares of other numbers.
Note that 1 is a square and we can always break a number as (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + â€¦).
Given a number n, find the minimum number of squares that sum to X.

Examples :
Input:  n = 100
Output: 1
100 can be written as 10^2.

Note that 100 can also be written as 5^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 5^2,
but this representation requires 4 squares.

Input:  n = 6
Output: 3
